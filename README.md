## What is it?
This repository includes the src/ files of a Trigger.io application built as part of my first coop-term at Mosaic.  Trigger.io is a service and framework for writing hybrid mobile applications in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and then using the code inside a web-wrapper on a mobile device.  For more details visit:
[Trigger.io website](https://trigger.io/how-it-works/)

The App developed is a sample Library application that demonstrates CRUD functionalitity, along with making use of Trigger.io's API to access native controls such as Push Notifications, native top-bar and tab-bar, and a native date-time picker.

## How does the Library Application work?
